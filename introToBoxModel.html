  <h1>A note on Section and Div</h1>
  <p>Throughout this document, you will see the &lt;section&gt; and &lt;div&gt; tags used. These tags allow us to divide the document into blocks (see more about blocks below). The div tag is for generic blocks (those without logical meaning in the document) and the section tag is for blocks that divide the document into logical sections (like you would find in an outline).</p>
</section>
<section id="inlineandblock">
  <h1>Inline and Block</h1>
  <p>Tags can be displayed as either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em> elements. Inline elements only take up the same amount of space as their contents. Think of inline elements as the highlighting that occurs when you select text in a word document. Block elements occupy a rectangular block of space, the same width as their container (by default, as we'll see we can change this). Think of block elements as drawing a rectangular box on the page that you can use to size, move, and arrange elements contained inside. We can learn more about Inline and Block by applying some simple css to the em and p tags.</p>
</section>
<section id="boxmodel">
  <h1>Box Model</h1>
  <p>Every block element defines a rectangle on the page. Each rectangle is surrounded by its:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Border:</em> if we draw a line showing the rectangle defined by the element, we draw its border.</li>
      <li><em>Margin:</em> the space between the border and the next element is the margin.</li>
      <li><em>Padding</em> the space between the content of the element and its border is the padding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The example below demonstrates the box model. In this example, the black line is the border, the green area is the margin, and the blue area is the padding.</p>
    <div id="boxmodeldemocon">
      <div id="boxmodeldemo">
        This is the content of the div. In this case the content is just text, but it could also include images, or other elements (including divs inside of divs). The space between this content and the black border is the padding. The green area outside the border is the margin.
      </div>
    </div>
<section id="widthMargins">
	<h1>Width, Margins, Padding and Borders</h1>
  <p>We can set width, margin, padding, and border properties on <em>block</em> elements. These values work differently, sometimes not at all, for inline elements. The way these values control how block elements take up space on the page is called the <em>box model</em>. The basic concept is simple. The width property sets the width of the element. The border sets the visible border of the element (if any). The margin sets the space between the border and the next element, and the padding sets the space between the border and the element's content. We'll see each of these in turn now.</p>
  <h2>Width</h2>
	<p>The width property lets us specify the width of a given element. Widths can be specified in three ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>As a percentage of the element's <em>container</em> (more on this in a minute).</li>
    <li>As a pixel value</li>
    <li>As an em value</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Just as with font size, pixels are a <em>absolute</em> measurement value whereas ems and percentages are <em>relative</em>. We'll discuss the merits of relative vs absolute measurements later on. Set the width of each div below to the value indicated by selecting each div by id in the style section. Note their appearance after setting the indicated width.</p>
	<div class="spaceExample" id="width1">
    width: 75%;
	</div>
  <div class="spaceExample" id="width2">
    width: 100px;
  </div>
  <div class="spaceExample" id="width3">
    width: <em>3</em>
  </div>
  <h2>Containers</h2>
  <p>When one block level element contains another, the larger element is called the container. The body element is the container of all other elements on the page. By default, block elements take up 100% of their container. When we set a percentage width, the element will take up that percentage <em>of its container</em>. Thus, the actual width of the element will depend on the width of the container itself! In the example below, the div with the class "demoContainer" is the container. NOTE: This class name is arbitrary. Any div can be a container! Just as in the last exercise, use the id of each div to set style rules to resize the container and the div inside and see what happens</p>
	<div class="demoContainer" id="container1">
    width: 50%;
    <div class="spaceExample" id="inside1">
      width: 50%;
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="demoContainer" id="container2">
    width: 300px;
    <div class="spaceExample" id="inside2">
      width: 75%;
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="demoContainer" id="container3">
    width: 200px;
    <div class="spaceExample" id="inside3">
      width: 300px;
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Border</h2>
  <p>The border property allows us to set a visible border around an element. It takes three values, width, style and color. This can be a little tricky to understand, so look up the border property, and ask for help if you need it.</p>
  <div class="demoContainer2">
    <div id="border1">
      border: 1px black solid;
    </div>
    <div id="border2">
      border: 2px red solid;
    </div>
    <div id="border3">
    border: 3px grey dashed;
    </div>
    <div id="border4">
      border: 1px;
      width: 50%;
      background-color: maroon;
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Margin</h2>
  <p>The margin property allows us to set space between the border of an element and its neighbors. The margin property can take one, two, or four values. If given one value, this value with set the margin for all four sides of the element. If given two values the first value sets the vertical margin and the second sets the horizontal. We'll deal with four later (it's rarely used).
    <div class="demoContainer2">
      <div id="margin1">
        border: 1px;
        margin-top: 10px;
        margin-bottom: 10px;
        margin-left: 10px;
        margin-right: 10px;
      </div>
      <div id="margin2">
        border: 1px, black, solid;
        margin: 10%, 5px, 10%, 5px;

      </div>
      <div id="margin3">
        margin: 2px, 25%, 2px, 25%;
      </div>
      <div id="margin4">
        background-color: maroon;
        margin: 0px, 15%, 0px, 15%;
      </div>
    </div>
  <h2>Padding</h2>
  <p>The padding property lets us set space between the border of an element and its content. Like the margin, it can take one, two or four values. A one value padding is applied to all four sides. For a two value padding the first value sets vertical padding and the second, horizontal.</p>
  <div class="demoContainer2">
    <div id="padding1">
      border: 1px, black, solid;
      margin: 10%;
    </div>
    <div id="padding2">
      border: 1px black solid;
      margin: 5px,10%, 5px, 10%;
      padding: 1px;
    </div>
    <div id="padding3">
      padding: 3px, 2px, 3px, 2px;
    </div>
    <div id="padding4">
      background-color: maroon;
      padding: 0px, 15%, 0px, 15%;
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Single-side properties</h2>
  <p>CSS also provides properties to set border, margins, and padding for each side of the element individually. For example border-bottom sets a border for the bottom of the element, padding-right sets padding for the right-hand side, margin-left sets a left-hand margin and etc. Let's try these out.</p>
  <div class="demoContainer2" style="width=80%;margin:0 5%">
    <div id="singleSide1">
      border-bottom-style: 1px grey solid;
    </div>
    <div id="singleSide1">
      margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 10%;
      border-top-style: 1px black dashed;
      padding-top: 1px;
    </div>
    <div id="singleSide2">
      width: 50%;
      margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 10%;
      border-right-style: 2px red solid;
    </div>
    <div id="singleSide3">
      background-color: maroon;
      margin: 3px, 5%, 3px, 3px;
    </div>
  </div>
